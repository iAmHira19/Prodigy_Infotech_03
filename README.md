For Dataset :- https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data

Here, I showcase my projects and experiments in machine learning and computer vision. Currently, I'm focused on implementing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify images of cats and dogs from the popular Kaggle dataset. This project utilizes Python, OpenCV for image processing, and Git LFS for managing large datasets efficiently.

Key Features:

Implementation of SVM for image classification.
Efficient preprocessing techniques including image resizing and normalization.
Utilization of Git LFS for handling large datasets like train.zip and test1.zip.
Exploration of SVM kernels and parameter tuning for optimal performance.
Continuous updates and improvements in machine learning techniques.
Future Directions:

Expand to explore deep learning approaches for enhanced classification accuracy.
Incorporate more advanced image processing techniques and data augmentation.
Collaborate with the community to tackle new challenges in AI and computer vision.
Stay tuned for updates and feel free to explore the code and contribute!
